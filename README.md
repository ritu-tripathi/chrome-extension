# chrome-extension
We all make use of some of chrome extensions in our daily life, so why not make one for ourselves?
I developed a fun little chrome extension called 'jokes'. Whenever you click on the extension it will present a joke on your screen and the joke changes with every click!
I took help from a youtube video. This project is developed with CSS, Javascript and HTML on VS code.
